            <p> According to the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9024616/#:~:text=Transitioning%20to%20plant%2Dbased%20diets,garnering%20substantial%20health%20co%2Dbenefits."> National Library of Medicine</a>, food systems within the agricultural sector were responsible for <em> 21 - 37% of all global greenhouse emissions </em> but "transitioning to plant-based diets has the potential to reduce diet-related land use by 76%, diet-related greenhouse gas emissions by 49%, eutrophication by 49%, and green and blue water use by 21% and 14%, respectively, whilst garnering substantial health co-benefits".</p>
