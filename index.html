                <p> In order to feed the 8.062 billion residents of Earth, the food industry requires countless amounts of resources. Food systems currently in place to produce, process, distribute, prepare, consume, and discard of food has led to a loss in the planets biodiversity through factors such as deforistation, overfishing, and ecosystem degeneration. In addition, the food industry accounts for about 1/3 of the planets total greenhouse gas emission, which takes into consideration energy required to handle water and food waste. Researchers have found that the average diet of developed nations includes a large amount of meat and dairy, two foods that require large allocations of land to function as animal farms. As the population continues to grow, and the diets of undeveloped nations comes to incorporate more meat, greenhouse gas emissions will only rise to even higher levels. By centering our diets around plant-based food, this will not only decrease the demand for animal products and therefore reduce greenhouse gas emsissions, but also reduce the risk of acquiring, or worsening, diseases such as diabetes, metabolic disorders, heart disease, and stroke. </p>

                <h2> What are plant-based diets?</h2>
                <p> Plant-based diets are defined to be meals that derive mainly from plants which not only includes fruits and vegetables but also; seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, whole grains, and oils. This diet does not necessarely reject all meat and dairy, people may eat chicken, beef, eggs, fish, and dairy products. The main source of nutrients however should come from plant-based food. 
                    <br> Here is a helpful guide illustrating some of the different variations in diet. Notice that some include small portions of meat but are plant-based nonetheless. </p>

                <h2> How does this relate to global warming? </h2>
                <p>An article posted by the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/food"> United Nations</a>, suggests that adopting a plant-based diet can reduce an individual's annual carbon footprint by up to <em> 2.1 tons </em> for vegans and <em> 1.5 tons </em> for vegetarians.</p>
