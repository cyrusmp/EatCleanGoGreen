                <p> In order to feed the 8.062 billion residents of Earth, the food industry requires countless amounts of resources. Current food systems has led to a loss in the planets biodiversity due to factors such as deforistation, overfishing, and ecosystem degeneration. In addition, the food industry accounts for 1/3 of the planets total greenhouse gas emission which takes into consideration energy required to handle water and food waste. Researchers have found the average diet of developed nations includes a large amount of meat and dairy, two foods that require large portions of land to be allocated for animal farms. As the population continues to grow and the diets of undeveloped nations improve, greenhouse gas emissions will rise to even higher levels but according to an article posted by the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/food"> United Nations</a>, adopting a plant-based diet can reduce an individual's annual carbon footprint by up to <em> 2.1 tons </em> for vegans and <em> 1.5 tons </em> for vegetarians.  </p>

                <h2> What are plant-based diets?</h2>
                <p> Plant-based diets are defined to be meals that derivce mainly from plants which not only includes fruits and vegetables but also; seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, whole grains, and oils. <br> Although it would be more impactful to cutting greenhouse gas emissions if one was to switch completely to a vegan diet, such a change is difficult which is why it's encouraged to at least enforce some meatless days throughout the week. </p>
