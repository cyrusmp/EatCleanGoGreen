            <p> While it would be more impactful to the planet if society was to switch completely to a vegan diet immiediately, such a change is difficult and not realistic. Luckily, there are steps that can be taken to slowly reduce dependence and desire for animal-products, creating positive outcomes both for yourself and the planet. </p>

            <h3>Pathway to Veganism</h3>
            <p> The following information is a guide with helpful tips and information </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meatless days: </strong> Numerous diet articles recommend cutting out red meat from your meals every other day. Once you have grown uccostomed to this, you may start to cut out fish and chicken. Sources of protein that can make great substitutions are: beans, peas, lentils, tofu, edamame, nuts, and seeds. </li>
                <li><strong>Animal-product replacements: </strong> Veganism goes beyond diets and involves other products such as soap, clothing, and other material goods. One should be sure to check the nutrition facts and company regulations and practices to ensure there aren't animal byproducts or resources being obtained in unethical ways. Sometimes, there is not always a perfect vegan replacement for every product, in which case its best to choose the lesser of two evils.</li>
                <li><strong>Meal planning: </strong> Planning meals not only helps you save money by preventing overspending, but it also allows you to determine plant-based substitutes and contributes to lessening food waste. For a healthy vegan diet, you should eat 5 portions of fruits and vegetables every day, along with some source of carbohydrate and dairy alternatives. </li>
