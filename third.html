            <p> While it would be more impactful to cutting greenhouse gas emissions if one was to switch completely to a vegan diet immiediately, such a change is difficult and not realistic which is why it's encouraged to at least start by enforcing some meatless days throughout the week. Not only would this help lessen the demand for animal products but it would also reduce the risk of acquiring, or worsening, diseases including; diabetes, metabolic disorders, heart disease, and stroke.</p>
